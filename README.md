### 📁 Folder Descriptions
**breeding-place-detection/** contains trained YOLO models (**YOLOv5s**, **YOLOv8n**, **YOLOv9s**) for mosquito breeding site detection.

**water-surface-segmentation/** contains YOLO segmentation models (**YOLOv11s-SIG**, **YOLOv8x-SIG**) for water surface identification.

**Docs/** holds the project poster and related documentation.

**01DataVisualization.ipynb** is a notebook for dataset visualization, exploratory analysis, and previewing detection or segmentation outputs.
